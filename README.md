My configuration files.

Some configurations use macOS-specific command line tools. If you try to run them elsewhere, they will fail, but it might be easy to adapt them to any *nix OS.

Here you can find configurations for:

- editorconfig
- ghostty
- git
- homebrew
- neovim
- starship
- tmux
- zsh
